<b>Just finished writing my fully working and functional #game-engine (Lumberjack) in #C++ and #objective-C++.
   I am a huge fan of C++ and love incorporating physics into my programming.
   I plan to expand and evolve this code to add more features.
   <br>Tool: #Xcode Library: #SFML<br><br><b>

1. Created shapes (tree, branches, player, clouds, bee, axe, log, gravestone) using SFML Texture, Sprite and draw and added movement to the shapes.<br>
2. Added a time bar to keep track of player’s remaining time as well as to respond when the player runs out of time.<br>
3. Handled player’s input (keyboard input, mouse positions and inputs) and player’s death.<br>
4. Added sound effects for log chopping, player ran out of time and player’s death using SFML sound class.<br>
5. Added score and message text using Text and Font class of SFML.<br>
6. Handled growing and updating branches, pausing and restarting the game and collision detection with screen and objects.
